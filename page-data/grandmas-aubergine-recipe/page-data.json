Here is mine:</p>\n<h2>Ingredients</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Chilli</li>\n<li>3 Cloves of garlic</li>\n<li>1 bunch of spring onions</li>\n<li>1 - 2 Aubergines (about 300g)</li>\n<li>50ml light soy sauce</li>\n<li>25ml dark soy sauce</li>\n<li>dash of rice vinegar</li>\n<li>2 tsp of sugar</li>\n<li>15ml of rice wine</li>\n<li>10ml of sesame oil</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Steps</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Cut the aubergine into cubes (roughly 3mm x 3mm)</li>\n<li>Stick the aubergine into the microwave and cook on full heat for approximately 5 minutes (aubergine will soak up a lot of oil whilst cooking. If we precook the aubergine, it allows us to use less oil)</li>\n<li>In the meantime, chop finely the garlic, chilli and spring onions</li>\n<li>In a separate container, mix the light soy sauce, dark soy sauce, vinegar, sugar, rice wine and sesame oil together</li>\n<li>Heat on a high heat, in a non stick wok 4-5 tsp of oil and add the garlic, chilli and spring onions and fry</li>\n<li>After about 2-3 minutes, add the aubergine and add the sauce that you’ve just mixed in a separate container</li>\n<li>Stir fry until the aubergine takes on the colour of the sauce, and most of the liquit is evaporated</li>\n</ol>","frontmatter":{"title":"","date":null,"description":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/grandmas-aubergine-recipe/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/my-third-post/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"My Third Post!"}},"next":null}}}
