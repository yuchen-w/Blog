It seems like every Chinese person I know seems to know how to stir fry Aubergine with a recipe that's been passed down the family. Here is mine:

## Ingredients 
1. Chilli
2. 3 Cloves of garlic
3. 1 bunch of spring onions
4. 1 - 2 Aubergines (about 300g)
5. 50ml light soy sauce
6. 25ml dark soy sauce
7. dash of rice vinegar
8. 2 tsp of sugar
9. 15ml of rice wine
10. 10ml of sesame oil

### Steps
1. Cut the aubergine into cubes (roughly 3mm x 3mm)
2. Stick the aubergine into the microwave and cook on full heat for approximately 5 minutes (aubergine will soak up a lot of oil whilst cooking. If we precook the aubergine, it allows us to use less oil)
3. In the meantime, chop finely the garlic, chilli and spring onions
4. In a separate container, mix the light soy sauce, dark soy sauce, vinegar, sugar, rice wine and sesame oil together
5. Heat on a high heat, in a non stick wok 4-5 tsp of oil and add the garlic, chilli and spring onions and fry
6. After about 2-3 minutes, add the aubergine and add the sauce that you've just mixed in a separate container
7. Stir fry until the aubergine takes on the colour of the sauce, and most of the liquit is evaporated
